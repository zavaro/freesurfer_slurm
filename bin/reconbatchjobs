# NAME
#
#  reconbatchjobs
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#  reconbatchjobs logfile cmdfile1 [cmdfile2 ...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#  reconbatchjobs is a worker-bee for the recon-all script, to
#  support running multiple instances of a binary (ie running
#  in parallel).  The main hurdles to running recon-all binaries
#  in parallel is making sure to get the return code, and to
#  buffer the log files (otherwise, if the output of parallel jobs
#  are simultaneously sent to the log file, then the log file
#  becomes an interleaved mess).
#
#  reconbatchjobs takes at least two arguments.  The first is the
#  filename to which command output should be appended when the
#  command (job) is finished.
#  The next argument(s) are files containing the command string
#  to execute.
#  For example usage, look in the recon-all script in the 'multi-strip'
#  section of the skull-strip stage.
#
#  Note: the commands are assumed to be independent of each other,
#  and a dependency chain is not supported (and so commands that need
#  to run in sequence should be handled by the caller, eg. recon-all)
